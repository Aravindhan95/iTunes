      "description":"Nolan Bishop has felt like an outsider in the Savage Kings MC, ever since he gave up the nomad lifestyle to try and put down some roots. He’s a convicted felon, searching for his place in the world without screwing up his probation.&#xa0;<br /><br />The last thing Nolan needs is a giant oaf from a rival biker gang showing up at the MC’s clubhouse, threatening to kill Nolan if he doesn’t give his estranged wife, Rita, a divorce.&#xa0;<br /><br />The funny thing is, Nolan is certain that he has never been married.&#xa0;<br /><br />The name Rita does, unfortunately, ring a bell - she’s the reason he went to prison.&#xa0;<br /><br />If Rita is lying about them being married, then she must be in serious trouble. Nolan just has to decide how much trouble the woman is worth.&#xa0;<br /><br />Unlike before, now he knows that even the smallest mistake could not only send him back to prison, but also endanger the lives of all the Savage Kings.&#xa0;"

Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible--inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse; their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming.",

With time running out and a deadly storm on the horizon that no one could survive, his hunters won’t leave the planet without Riddick’s head as their trophy. Also starring Katee Sackhoff (TV’s Battlestar Galactica), Karl Urban (Star Trek Into Darkness) and Dave Bautista (WWE). Experience the Riddick Unrated Director’s Cut with an alternate ending!"

Leonard (Guy Pearce) is a man who is struggling to put his life back together after the brutal rape and murder of his wife. But Leonard's problems are different from those of most people in his situation; he was beaten severely by the same man who killed his wife. The most significant manifestation of Leonard's injuries is that his short-term memory has been destroyed; he is incapable of retaining any new information, and must resort to copious note-taking and Polaroid photographs in order to keep track of what happens to him over the course of a day (he's even tattooed himself with a few crucial bits of information he can't get along without). Leonard retains awareness that his wife was brutally murdered, however, and he's convinced that the culprit still walks the streets. Leonard is obsessed with the notion of taking revenge against the man who has ruined his life, and he sets out to find him, getting help from Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), who appears to be a sympathetic barmaid, and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), who claims to be Leonard's friend, even though Leonard senses that he cannot be trusted."

      "longDescription":"The essence of baseball is the primal battle between the pitcher and batter, but the magic of the game arises from that confrontation, only 396 milliseconds in the making. The mysteries and memories of Baseball's greatest heroes are revealed in FASTBALL, featuring interviews with dozens of former players, from legendary Hall of Famers to up-and-coming All-Stars, including HANK AARON, NOLAN RYAN, & DEREK JETER, and narrated by KEVIN COSTNER. Based on the original idea by the film’s producer, Thomas Tull (\"Dark Knight\") who also produced the Jackie Robinson biopic \"42,\" FASTBALL is peppered with archival footage of baseball's greatest moments plus original high-speed 4K footage and motion graphics that unlock the secrets hidden within a ball traveling over 100 mph. While players, historians, and scientists might disagree on who was actually the fastest pitcher in history - and yes, the film does the physics and concludes with a clear verdict - FASTBALL tells the story of the game itself.",
